#Create an Animal class
#Every animal has a hunger value, which is a whole number
#Every animal has a thirst value, which is a whole number
#when creating a new animal object these values are created with the default 50 value
#Every animal can eat() which decreases their hunger by one
#Every animal can drink() which decreases their thirst by one
#Every animal can play() which increases both by one
