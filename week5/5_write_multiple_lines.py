# Create a function that takes 3 parameters: a path, a word and a number
# and is able to write into a file.
# The path parameter should be a string that describes the location of the file you wish to modify
# The word parameter should also be a string that will be written to the file as individual lines
# The number parameter should describe how many lines the file should have.
# If the word is "apple" and the number is 5, it should write 5 lines
# into the file and each line should read "apple"
# The function should not raise any errors if it could not write the file.
